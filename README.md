# Miscue Studio

[Miscue analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscue_analysis) is a diagnostic
tool to help teachers better understand the reading ability of their
students. This webapp enables teachers to digitally annotate reading material
with a representation of the way it was actually read by a student. The webapp
can then use these annotations to generate statistics about the studentâ€™s
reading ability, and track their progress over time. Work in progress.

Rails backend can be found

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React
App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
